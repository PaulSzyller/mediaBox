# Contribution Guidelines

After the first wave of initial setup steps, please follow those directions when working on the app on your own:  
  
  -ONLY THE FIRST TIME, clone the repo
  
  -make sure your local repo is on the master branch  
  `$ git checkout master`  
  
  -make sure master is up to date   
  `$ git pull origin master`

  -create and switch to a new branch with descriptive name  
  `$ git checkout -b myNewFeature`  

  -make all your desired changes  

  -add and commit your changes to your branch  
  `$ git add myModifiedFile.php`  
  `$ git commit -m "I modified a file"`  

  -push your branch to the github repo  
  `$ git push origin myNewFeature`  

  -create a pull request on github  

  -either we decide on 1 person that approves every PR or we can review them together, and merge them to the master
